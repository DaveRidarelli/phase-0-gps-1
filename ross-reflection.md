* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?   
Not so much GIT but the GitHub process wasn't something I was grasping fully.  Not commands, just workflow.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?      
How to operate as Driver/Navigator and work together to complete
challenges.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?    
We asked for clarification for `remote` as part of the `git push` syntax
as we weren't sure but assumed we needed to retype the `url` longhand.

* What still confuses you about Git?     
Let's say two people are working on a project and one person finishes
their "feature" before the second person.  Now person 2 is working on outdated code.  Should person 2 get the updated code ASAP from person 1 or should they continue working as-is?

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?    
I was very nervous as I did not know what to expect.  As a result
I was very flustered and made some careless mistakes.  I hope the 
next one runs a bit smoother for me.
