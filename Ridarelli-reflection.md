What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

	I had never used the fetch command before. I would struggle with the end of some commands such as remembering to add a commit message or pushing the correct branch with the git push origin command

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	I used the fetch command and got in good repetitions and experience with my partner and guide.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	We ended up in the VIM and needed a little assistance from our guide. We also asked each other about best practices with the questions in the releases.

What still confuses you about Git?
	I feel good about using Git conceptually. I think I just need to continue getting repetitions in with it with great practices.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	It went really smoothly. Neither of us knew what to expect. Me and my pair were patient and worked together well through all the releases and corrected our mistakes quickly and considerately.
